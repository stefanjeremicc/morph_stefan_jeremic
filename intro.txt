# Task 2a - Logic
###########
Create a function that takes the string parameter and returns true or false if the parentheses in the string
are correctly matched and each one is accounted for. For example:
If the input is (Welcome (to (Morph))), then the output should be true, but if the input is Welcome (to
(the (Morph) then the output should be false, because the parentheses do not correctly match up.
Edge case: if the input does not contain parentheses, return true.
Examples:
Input: "Lorem ((ipsum)(dolor)sit)"
Output: true
Input: "(Lorem (ipsum dolor)sit"
Output: false

Create a function that validates password and returns strong, medium, weak, based on the password
strength. Check the strength of a password that user enters based on the following rules:
➔ The password is at least 8 characters long
➔ The password has at least one uppercase letter
➔ The password has at least one lowercase letter
➔ The password has at least one digit
➔ The password has at least one special character
Strong: if the password has at least one lowercase letter, one uppercase letter, one digit, one special
character, and at least 8 characters.
Medium: If the password is at least six characters long and meets all the other requirements, or has no digit
but meets the rest of the requirements.
Weak: If the password entered does not meet the strong or medium-level requirements, then it is deemed
weak.
Instructions for delivery
When it comes to delivering results, it would be best to push it on github or bitbucket. It would be best to
have 3 branches, one for each task.
